        "# Python OOPs\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which contain data (fields) and code (methods).  \n",
        " It promotes modularity, code reuse, and abstraction through principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  \n",
        " Languages like Java, Python, and C++ use OOP to build scalable and maintainable applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects.  \n",
        "  It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object in OOP is an instance of a class that holds actual values for the\n",
        "  attributes defined in the class.  \n",
        "  It represents a real-world entity and can perform actions using its methods.  \n",
        "  For example, `myCar = Car()` creates an object `myCar` from the `Car` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the  \n",
        "  necessary features to the user, focusing on *what* an object does.  \n",
        "  Encapsulation binds data and methods together within a class and restricts direct access, focusing on *how* data is protected.  \n",
        "  In short, abstraction is about hiding complexity, while encapsulation is about hiding data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods in Python are special methods with double underscores (like `__init__`, `__str__`) used to define object behavior for built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        " - Inheritance in OOP allows a class (child) to acquire properties and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same superclass, enabling method overriding or overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using access modifiers like private (`__var`) and protected (`_var`) to restrict direct access to variables and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. H What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method named `__init__` that is automatically called when a new object is created to initialize its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " - Class methods use the `@classmethod` decorator and take `cls` as the first argument to access or modify class state, while static methods use the `@staticmethod` decorator and don’t access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " - Method overloading in Python means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, though Python doesn't support it natively and uses default arguments or `*args`/`**args` to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " - Method overriding in OOP is when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method already defined in its parent class, using the same name and parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - The `@property` decorator in Python is used to define a method as a read-only property, allowing access like an attribute while using method logic internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows different objects to be treated through a common interface, enabling flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used to define a common interface, containing one or more abstract methods using the `abc` module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " - Advantages of OOP include code reusability through inheritance, modularity via classes, easier maintenance, and improved scalability with abstraction and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - A class variable is shared by all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each object and defined inside the constructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, combining their features into a single subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        " - The `__str__` method returns a user-friendly string representation of an object, while `__repr__` returns an unambiguous string useful for debugging and development.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        " - The `super()` function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class, allowing access to inherited methods without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The `__del__` method in Python is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, used to perform cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " - `@staticmethod` defines a method that doesn't access class or instance data, while `@classmethod` takes `cls` as the first parameter and can access or modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance works by allowing a child class to override methods from the parent class, enabling different behaviors while using a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " - Method chaining in Python OOP is the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line by returning `self` from each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The `__call__` method in Python allows an object to be called like a function, enabling custom behavior when the object is \"called\" using parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
